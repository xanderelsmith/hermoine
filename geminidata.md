The word digital implies that, information in the
system is represented by values that are limited in
number. The values hence used to represent the
information are called quantized or discrete values.
These values are processed by circuit components
that maintain the limited set of values. A digital
system performs more reliably and efficiently if it
handles only two values (“0” and “1”) that is only
two states and such a digital system will be called a
two state system or a binary system.
There are two broad categories of electronic circuits
and systems—analog and digital circuit and systems.
A continuous signal that can have any magnitude in
a given range of time is called analog signal for
example growth of a living creature such as a child
and a plant. A system having analog circuit and/or
devices is called analog electronics. On the other
hand, a signal having only two discrete values is
called digital signal. The number of students in a
class is an example digital signal. The branch of
electronics that deals with the digital devices,
circuits, and systems is called digital electronics. The
digital circuits are mainly of two different types— combinational and sequential circuits.
Digital electronics is concerned
with two-state switching type
circuits in which signals are in the
form of electrical pulses. The
outputs and inputs of digital
devices involve only two levels of
voltage referred “high” and “low”.
In digital systems, the
information being operated
on is usually present in
binary form. In fact, digital
electronics is the world of
logical 0s and 1s.
Digital circuits are used in hand-held
calculators, electronic watches,
computers, in control systems (for
domestic appliances such as washing
machines, for robots and for
production processes in industry), TV
and other games and, increasingly, in
electronic telecommunication.
Digital circuits are also used
in digital Multimeters
(DMMs) and digital
capacitance meters and
frequency meters etc

                                             . What is thermodynamics?
a) study of the relationship between heat and other forms of energy
b) study of the conversion of chemical energy to other forms of energy
c) study of the relationship between mechanical energy to other forms of energy
d) study of the conversion of mechanical energy to other forms of energy
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: The branch of physical science is concerned with the relationship between heat, and other forms of energy like mechanical, electrical, chemical energy, etc.

2. Which of the following is a branch of thermodynamics?
a) Equilibrium thermodynamics
b) Classical thermodynamics
c) Chemical thermodynamics
d) All of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: The branches of thermodynamics include:
1) Equilibrium thermodynamics
2) Classical thermodynamics
3) Chemical thermodynamics
4) Statistical mechanics or Statistical thermodynamics
3. Which of the following is a thermodynamics law?
a) Zeroth law of thermodynamics
b) Faraday’s Law of thermodynamics
c) Ideal Gas Law of thermodynamics
d) Boyle’s Law of thermodynamics
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Thermodynamics is primarily based on a set of four rules that are universally applicable when applied to systems that fall within their respective limitations. They are as follows:
Zeroth law of thermodynamics
First law of thermodynamics
Second law of thermodynamics
Third law of thermodynamics
4. Heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter one. Which of the following thermodynamics law states this?
a) Zeroth law of thermodynamics
b) First law of thermodynamics
c) Second law of thermodynamics
d) Third law of thermodynamics
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The concept of entropy as a physical attribute of a thermodynamic system is established by the second law of thermodynamics. Despite following the necessity of energy conservation as specified in the first law of thermodynamics, entropy predicts the direction of spontaneous processes and determines whether they are irreversible or impossible.
5. Which of the following is an application of thermodynamics?
a) Refrigerators
b) Gas compressors
c) Power plants
d) All of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The second law of thermodynamics applies to all refrigerators, deep freezers, industrial refrigeration systems, all forms of air-conditioning systems, heat pumps, and so on. Thermodynamic cycles govern the operation of all forms of air and gas compressors, blowers, and fans. The study of the feasibility of employing various forms of renewable energy sources for household and commercial purposes is an important topic area of thermodynamics
6. Which of the following is a type of thermodynamic system?
a) Open system
b) Closed system
c) Thermally isolated system
d) All of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: The types of thermodynamic systems are:
i) Open system
ii) Closed system
iii) Thermally isolated system
iv) Mechanically isolated system
v) Isolated system
7. Which of the following occurs without a change in the internal energy?
a) Isochoric process
b) Isenthalpic process
c) Steady-state process
d) Isenthalpic process
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The following are some of the most commonly studied thermodynamic processes:
i) Heat does not lose or acquire energy in an adiabatic process.
ii) At a constant enthalpy, the isenthalpic process occurs.
iii) The isobaric process happens when the pressure remains constant.
iv) The isochoric process (also known as isometric/isovolumetric) happens at a constant volume.
v) At a constant temperature, an isothermal process occurs.
vi) Internal energy does not change in a steady-state operation.
vii) Isentropic process: adiabatic reversible process with constant entropy.
8. Which of the following thermodynamic law gives the concept of enthalpy?
a) First law of thermodynamics
b) Second law of thermodynamics
c) Third law of thermodynamics
d) Fourth law of thermodynamics
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The first law of thermodynamics connects a system’s many kinds of kinetic and potential energy to the work it can do and the heat it can transfer. This law, which also includes an extra state variable, enthalpy, is occasionally used to define internal energy.
9. What is the value of the absolute thermodynamic temperature scale?
a) 3K
b) 0K
c) 1K
d) 4K
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: The temperature of an object on a scale with 0 as absolute zero is known as absolute temperature, also known as thermodynamic temperature. Kelvin and Rankine are absolute temperature scales.
10. Which of the following follows the Carnot theorem?
a) Heat engines
b) Gas turbine engines
c) Gas compressors
d) All of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: Carnot’s theorem states that all heat engines between two heat reservoirs are less efficient than a Carnot heat engine operating between the same reservoirs.
11. If a piston/cylinder with a cross-sectional size of 0.01 m2 is resting on the stops, what should the water pressure be to lift the piston with an outside pressure of 100 kPa?
a) 218kPa
b) 168kPa
c) 198kPa
d) 318kPa
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Pw = Po + mg/A = 100000 + (100*9.8/0.01) = 198kPa.
12. At 100°C, a sealed rigid vessel with a volume of 1 m3 and 2 kg of water has a volume of 1 m3. The vessel has now been warmed up. What pressure should a safety pressure valve be adjusted to achieve a maximum temperature of 200°C if one is installed?
a) 431.3 kPa
b) 231.3 kPa
c) 831.3 kPa
d) 131.3 kPa
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Initial specific volume (v1) = 1 m3/2 kg = 0.5 m3/kg
Interpolating, pressure for the same specific volume at 200°C
= 400 + {(0.53422-0.5)/(0.53422-0.42492)}*(500-400) = 431.3 kPa.
13. When the diver is 8 meters below the surface, the pressure gauge on his air tank reads 60 kPa. The gauge pressure will be 0 at what depth?
a) 44.118 m
b) 24.118 m
c) 34.118 m
d) None of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Pressure at 10 m depth = Patm + ρgh = 101.325 + 1000*9.80665*8/1000 = 179.778 kPa
Absolute pressure of the air in the tank = 179.778 + 60 = 239.778 kPa
Depth at which gauge pressure is zero (H) = (239.778 – 101.325)*1000/(1000*9.80665) = 14.118 m.

19. A refrigerator with a 2 kW motor for powering the compressor gives 6000 kJ of cooling to the refrigerated space during 30 minutes of operation in a thermally insulated kitchen. Calculate the change in internal energy of the kitchen if the condenser coil behind the refrigerator rejects 8000 kJ of heat to the kitchen over the same time period.
a) 3600 kJ
b) 2400 kJ
c) 4800 kJ
d) none of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: QKitchen = 0 (Insulated!),
W(Electrical) = – P*∆τ = – 2 kW*30*60 sec = – 3600 kJ
(It is negative because work is done on to the system)
Change in internal energy of the kitchen (∆UKitchen) = QKitchen – WElectrical
= 0 – (–3600) = 3600 kJ.
